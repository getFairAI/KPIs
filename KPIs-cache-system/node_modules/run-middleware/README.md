NodeJS module to execute your Express endpoints (middlewares) from your code. This module will let you manually launch all your middleware. It is simulating a client calling your rest APIs, without using a network connection (your server does not even need to listen on a port).

## Why?

Many times, your server and your client, need to execute the same functions. For example here is an endpoint to get user details:

    app.get('/get-user/:id',function(req,res){
    	mysql.query('select * from users where id=?',[req.params.id],function(err,rows){
    		res.send({user:rows[0]})
    	})
    })

Now you want to get the user details from your code. What should you do?

    app.runMiddleware('/get-user/20',function(code,body,headers){
    	console.log('User Details:',body)
    })

## Installation

    npm i -S run-middleware

    var express=require('express')
    var app=express();
    require('run-middleware')(app)

## Support & Contributions

* Pull requests, issues, and English proofreading are welcome on Github.
* Question & support on StackOverflow using `run-middleware`tag.

## Change request paramaters

As options you can pass the `query`, `body`, `method`, `cookies` parameters.

    app.runMiddleware('/handler',{
    		method:'post',
    		query:{token:'tk-12345'},
    		body:{"action":"list","path":"/"}
    	},function(code,data){
    		console.log(code,data)
    		process.exit()
    	})

## Auto pass cookies

When you can runMiddleware from another middleware, you can autopass all the parameters of the current middleware, by using the express `request` object.

    app.get('/middleware1',function(req,res){
    	// We use res.runMiddleware instead of app.runMiddleware. All the cookies & other data (like socket.io session) will be pass to the second middleware
    	res.runMidleware(...)
    })

## Redirecting

If the middleware you execute will redirect, you will be notified about it, by reading the `code` and the `headers.location`

    app.runMiddleware('/this-middleware-will-response-as-redirect',function(code,body,headers){
    	if(code==301 || code=302) {// Redirect HTTP codes
    		console.log('Redirect to:',headers.location)
    	}
    })
