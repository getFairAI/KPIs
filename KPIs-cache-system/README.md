#### Important:

- Default port: `3003`.
- This server's configuration and api settings are located in `/app/config`.

#### How to run it:

Clone this repo, open a terminal in the root folder, do `npm install` (any version of NPM/Node should work, but I recommend 15.14.0 since it was the one where it was developed). Then to `npm start` (uses nodemon) or `node server.js` (does not use nodemon) still in the root folder.
